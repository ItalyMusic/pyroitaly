        The difference from :meth:`~pyroitaly.Client.get_listener_matching_with_data` is that this method
        intends to get a listener by passing partial info of the listener identifier, while the other method
        intends to get a listener by passing the full info of the update data, which the listener should match with.

        Parameters:
            pattern (:obj:`~pyroitaly.types.Identifier`):
                The Identifier to match agains.

            listener_type (:obj:`~pyroitaly.enums.ListenerTypes`):
                The type of listener to get.

        Returns:
            List of :obj:`~pyroitaly.types.Listener`: On success, a list of Listener is returned.
