class Restart:
    async def restart(
        self: "pyroitaly.Client",
        block: bool = True
    ):
        """Restart the Client.

        This method will first call :meth:`~pyroitaly.Client.stop` and then :meth:`~pyroitaly.Client.start` in a row in
        order to restart a client using a single method.

        Parameters:
            block (``bool``, *optional*):
                Blocks the code execution until the client has been restarted. It is useful with ``block=False`` in case
                you want to restart the own client within an handler in order not to cause a deadlock.
                Defaults to True.

        Returns:
            :obj:`~pyroitaly.Client`: The restarted client itself.

        Raises:
            ConnectionError: In case you try to restart a stopped Client.

        Example:
            .. code-block:: python

                from pyroitaly import Client

                app = Client("my_account")

                    ...  # Invoke other API methods
                    await app.stop()
